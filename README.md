# Quadcopter Trajectory Tracking and Control Simulator

I am developing this project right now. 

The goal is to build a simulation environment in C++ that can be used to understand how a particular cascaded PID control architecture can be used for quadcopter trajectory tracking in cluttered 3D spaces. For this project, I am developing all submodules from scratch, including the physics or dynamics model of the quadcopter, the implementation of the PID controllers, the cost functions to aid in performance evaluation, the path and trajectory planning algorithms (I have devised a minimum snap algorithm from scratch, for example, using quintic polynomial interpolation with natural boundary condition constraints), and the visualization tools to help understand the performance of the control system.

Please proceed to view the source code that I have been working on, but please also realize that I'm working on the code as we speak, so the code is not yet complete. I will update this README file as I make progress.
